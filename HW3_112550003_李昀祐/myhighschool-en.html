            <h2>School Introduction</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1904, the school originated as "Taipei First Girls High School" during the Japanese colonial period. After Taiwan's retrocession, it was officially renamed "Taiwan Provincial Taipei First Girls High School" on December 12, 1945. In October 1949, a night school was established, and in August 1963, a supplementary school for girls was added. In July 1967, after Taipei became a municipality, the school was renamed "Taipei First Girls High School," and the night school was officially closed in July 1982. In 2004, the school celebrated its centenary, and the supplementary school became part of history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over a century, the school has approximately 2,000 students and offers regular classes, gifted classes in science and mathematics, and classes in humanities and social sciences. For over a century, Taipei First Girls High School has been a temple of education and cultural transmission. Whether as "First Girls High School" during the Japanese occupation or "Taipei First Girls High School" since the retrocession, it has always been an ideal school for female students across Taiwan. Under the leadership of successive principals and the guidance of numerous excellent teachers, the school has established a strong reputation for its educational excellence. The principals have dedicated themselves to the school's development while seeking innovation and progress. The teaching staff continually improve their professional skills, leading to remarkable student learning outcomes and creating a campus culture that strives for excellence. Over the years, many students have thrived in this nurturing environment, benefitting from the school's comprehensive education. The legacy of alumni is visible both domestically and internationally, showcasing the spirit of "managing the family and the country, excelling in both fields" and witnessing Taiwan's social progress over the past century. The trend of women excelling in society reflects the achievements of elite women's education and the fruits of nurturing over a century.</p>
